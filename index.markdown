title: Welcome to My Project Management Capstone!
---

The purpose of this page is to show you how I've used the principles and methodologies of project management to create my own project which, intentionally, is about me getting my first job in project management. 

## About Me

I am a project manager with over 10 years of experience in team management, problem-solving, and planning. I have domain expertise in public education, microbiology, health and fitness, data analysis, and application development. Based out of Nashville, Tennessee, you'll find me working out, drinking espresso, reading, or spending time with my wife and friends if I'm not walking the hills of the Cumberland Plateau. When I'm at work, I'm focused on delivering the best product or service to customers as possible.
