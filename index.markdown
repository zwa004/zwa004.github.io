## About Me

My name is Zach and I am a project manager with over 10 years of experience in team management, problem-solving, and planning. I have domain expertise in public education, microbiology, health and fitness, data analysis, and application development. Based out of Nashville, Tennessee, you'll find me working out, drinking espresso, reading, or spending time with my wife and friends if I'm not walking the hills of the Cumberland Plateau. When I'm at work, I'm focused on delivering the best product or service to customers as possible. 

## About this Website

The purpose of this website is to display my Capstone Project: Break into Project Managment. On the pages of this site you will find the documents needed to initiate, plan, execute, monitor and control, and close a successfully managed project.

#### What this Website Doesn't Show

While this project is meant to display my grasp of technical project management concepts, I firmly believe that every successful project will, at its heart, be made of a team of people who feel seen and valued professionally. I also believe that project managers are critical to sustaining and building a culture that supports the kind of team that people want to be on.
