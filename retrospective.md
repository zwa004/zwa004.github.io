# Introduction
The purpose of this endeavor was to demonstrate my ability to start, manage, and close an IT-based project to prospective employers. To make it unique, I also opted to execute the deliverables given my current work experience. My objectives for this project were to:
- Create the JAT
- Create the GitHub Page
- Document the process of the project from initiaion to close
- Create an example of my projectmanagement skills to share with potential employers

# What Went Well
- The Coursera: Google Project Management
    - I gained valuable knowledge of methodologies like waterfall and agile
    - I learned about the lifecycle of a typical project
    - I reflected on my previous work experience and how it relates to skills project managers frequently use
- Creating the JAT
    - I created and deployed an application that is demonstrative and serves a purpose

# What Were the Challenges?
- Editing the GitHub page
    - I haven't worked with ruby or jekyll before, so I fell behind schedule editing and deploying this page
- Creating a schedule
    - I started this project retroactively (after I started working on the JAT). This meant creating the charter and initiating documentation after reaching goals and making other deliverables

# Lessons Learned
- Waterfall methodology is a structured way for a team to reach goals by working together when the goal is clear and usually unchanging.
- Agile is a methodology that is flexible, coaching-focused, and best-suited for projects that have more ambiguous or uncertain goals. 
- There are many different tools project managers use, but they all serve the purpose of organizing tasks and goals, communicating with the right people the best way, and delivering value to the organization.
- Change is unchanging. Expect it and prepare for it. 
- I learned that I will enjoy project management. I understand the importance of processes and embrace working with people. I fully believe that a project will be as successful as it can be when process are followed and when people are valued, known, and loved. 

# Next Steps
- Apply for project managment roles and add the data to the JAT
- Analyze and visualize the data from the JAT
- Sit and pass the Certified Associate Project Manager exam

# Conclusion
This project was a great way for me to dip my toes into the field of project management, and my only regret is that I didn't jumped sooner. I hit my goals of creating the JAT, GitHub Page, and documentation of this project. My remaining goals: interview and accept an offer at your organization will signal the conclusion of this project, and the beginning of many more!

If you've made it this far in my retrospective, I'm grateful for your attention and time. You get bonus points if you answer this question when we speak again: It's game night with your friends or family. Do you hate to lose or do you love to win?
